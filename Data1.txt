Yes mr. Lupita right now you are speaking with James Watson I'm the senior divisional head of Criminal Investigation Department of IRS 
We are calling to inform you that the IRS has determined some miscalculations with your taxes and the audit has revealed several inconsistencies
The total amount you are owed to the federal government is two thousand three hundred dollars
How much money do you have in your checking account
Okay we can probably manage with 3000 dollars
You will need to pay this using a tax pay voucher at a federally authorised store
you owe the IRS the full amount right now
there are two ways of resolving this right now you can either resolve this out of court or hire a criminal attorney to fight this
you will be arrested and put in prison if you don't pay us the amount right now
Let me tell you that for this uh pending tax against that you have an arrest warrant on your name
the police have an arrest warrant under your name
I would request you please do not interrupt me while I'm reading it out to you who can these lines are being subtly reported and monitored by the Department of Justice so anything you see on these lines may be used in your favor or against you
Well uh sir it's your choice because this call will be recorded and monitored from the headquarters from the local courthouse and local authorities
Do not disconnect the line otherwise you will be arrested by local authorities in 1 hour
you need to pay this now
