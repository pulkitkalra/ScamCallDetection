starting off we are above a caravan park 		
we are going to go due south straight south and then we're going to g-- turn straight back round and head north past an old mill on the right hand side 	
due south and then back up again 	
yeah 	
south and then straight back up again with an old mill on the right and you're going to pass on the left-hand side of the mill 	
and then we're going to turn east 	
not straight east slightly sort of northeast 	
s-- slightly northeast 	
slightly slightly yeah 	
very slightly 	
and we're going to continue straight along erm quite a wee dis-- a wee distance erm quite a wee distance right we're going to continue along on that course 	
and then we're going to turn north again 	
and immediat-- well a distance below that turning point there's a fenced meadow 	
but you should be avoiding that by quite a distance 	
so we've turned and we're going up north again 	
continue straight up north 	
and then we're going to turn to the west on a curvature right sort of 	
"s" bend and immediately below that bend there is an abandoned cottage 	
and we're passing above the top of that 	
we're going to continue in that sort of "s" shape a big wide "s" 	
and on the sort of top erm left of that again below it there's a fenced meadow 	
but you're passing on the top of that 	
we've gone from the abandoned cottage right and we're on the sort of "s" shape yeah 	
and then at the top of the "s" we're turning north 	
we're going straight due north 	
at the top there there's a west lake 	
which we're going to pass on the south erm southeast side 	
and we're going to do that in a curve almost a half "u" shape 	
half "u" shape to the southeast 	
and continue up north slightly 	
but not quite to the tip of that lake 	
and then we're going to turn down ove-- above a trig point and we're going to turn immediately to your right and straight down at an angle of forty-five 	
and we're going to continue that wee distance down and that the point at the end of that it should be near to the abandoned cottage where we went past miles away but if not just carry on and then continue down in that forty-five degree 	
and turn round by a monument on the outside of the monument 	
outside of the monument 	
and then a very slight turning up again north sort of northwest 	
very slight curve sort of very slight "s"-shaped just a slight curve and then going to proceed up north again 	
on the right-hand side there's a nuclear test site before right before reaching the top of that northbound 	
and then you're going to turn back west 	
and above that there's an east lake 	
and that's the finish 	
slightly different
