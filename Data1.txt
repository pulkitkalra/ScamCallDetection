Internal revenue services how may I help you
yes first of all let me just grab it your information you got the text from the same number
you got the receipt call or text on the same number 
so the reason why we are trying to reach you is to inform you that there's an arrest warrant issued against your name and your physical address 
and your physical address isn't referential addressing investigation so did you receive a phone call from your local police department
so I'm telling you everything that's are you trying to say that you are not I've heard about the situations happening under your name 
so as for the information of Act 1928 you do have the right to get the information before you get arrested so that's what the law I can provide you a little information on the phone 
but you make sure that you do not interrupt me while I am providing you all the information okay
right and it is also my job to make you aware that this is a three-way conference with the Department of Homeland Security so whatever you speak or commit must be truth and honest
because this is phone recording we'll be serving in front of the bar Council of your state to prove yourself innocent or guilty 
now you have found suspicious and breaking three important laws of United States number one was the Internal Revenue Service and number two a wireless and a federal taxes and regulation number three providing misleading information to the government 
now I want to ask you one question that was taking care of your taxes I mean yourself or you have a public accountant
and just because of those errors that is a miscalculated tax amount pending on your name and which you still owe to the government and the amount is $2,495 
okay so let me just go to and first of all and so now I have a few legal questions which I need
to get an answer from you in simple yes or no only  so have you ever been arrested before by the state police or any service departments  
have you ever filed a bankruptcy or foreclosure in the past
are there any judgments which are still pending on your name 
okay so I believe that you have answered all of my questions with almost honestly
now proceeding further is to provide you limited information which I believe already did 
so now you have two of the left the number one that either you can resolve this matter outside of the court without facing the legal consequences 
or you can fight the case against the government in the courthouse where in the government is going to sue you more than $35,000 
and they will be sending you three years of federal imprisonment detention center right 
so once we disconnect this line within 45 minutes you will be arrested by the local police
department and they will seize your property bank account and they'll also block your social security number
so now this is the last and final chance for you to say something about matter so you tell me that how do you deal with this issue 
yeah because issue is that the arrest warrant is issued directly on your name
but the thing is you’re a  genuine person that's why this is the first and last chance to call you so before disconnecting this line we can do anything so you would like to go for the legal consequences 
I need to forward your file to a local police station and now they will handle your cash and the court will sue you as well 
and if you want to resolve this case outside of the card then this is the last chance for you before disconnecting this line okay 
you have to just pay your due amount $2,495 then we can cancel your arrest warrant 
yes you had to pay us $2,495 instantly before disconnecting this line so we can cancel
your arrest warrant and that's all and we just closed this matters outside of the court
I mean you have to pay the fifty percent of your total amount and the fifty percent would be a tomorrow or next day only that's only the first and last option 
so you have to pay at least $1,200 today I mean we did 45 minutes that's the only plan we have that's why I'm telling you that if you like you to go the legal consequences that I don't mind at all 
but if you want to resolve this case outside of the court and before this disconnecting these lines I need to do anything otherwise we cannot so it’s up to you now you tell me 
none of my business my friend I'm just helping you
that's I'm telling you that if you argue with the legal consequences then what happened to your kids to think about it
I do listen to all of your concern but that's I mean my doing the my job and I'm just helping you out as I can so you just tell me that what you want to do for that 
because don’t want to waste your time don't want to waste my time 
so tell me I mean you want to resolve this case or should I go for the legal subsequences that's hold the line and I need to speak to my accounting department just hold the line okay 
okay the just hold the line and I’ll transfer this line to my accounting department okay you
My name is mr. Sean Martin can you give me a person so I can pull up information sir
and he just told you an amount 
$2,495 so you can note it down 
information but you're not written down on the paper so I think you need to contact your local police department 
so then I just came on the line with you you need to drive your car to the  local police department I'd to send this information from there with the arrest warrant copy
no sir you need to go to your local police department sir I just came on the line
you need to drive your car to the local police department or any of the Sheriff Department which one is nearest to you 
Sorry sir don't give me any argument but you need to would you move a phone and a speaker mode and then you can drive your car goes to the local police department
