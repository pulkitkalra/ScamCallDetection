Thank you for calling IRS, how may I help you?
Well sir, this is the Investigation Department IRS.
Well, are you sure you got a call from the IRS?
My name is Kendall Cheeserton how can I help?
Yes, but I don’t find your information, and you might have got the voice message by mistake.
Yes sir, ok if you say so.
So do you know how much you owe the IRS?
Well yes its three thousand four hundred and twenty three dollars.
It’s between 2008 to 2012.
Let me tell you that for this uh pending tax against that you have an arrest warrant on your name.
Yes sir, you’re having an arrest warrant on your name.
Do you have this three thousand four hundred and twenty three dollars?
Um, hold on sir, ok?
I will let me talk to my supervisor please.
I transfer the call to the supervisor.
I am Kelly Johnson
Thanks for holding, your call has been transferred to senior investigation officer kevin wilson, to whom and I talking with?
My name is wilson, kevin wilson.
Please be online sir.
Let me check your files out.
Please give me a chance to check it out, and I’ll give you a call back in half an hour.
Do one thing mr. kendall please listen to me.
Is this a problem for you or someone else?
Let me confirm that, I’m very confused.
Do you have this amount to pay now?
Just do one thing - just get in your car, keep this phone on speakerphone mode and drive to the bank.
When the bank asks you why you are withdrawing this amount.
If you’re having an arrest warrant, there is a red flag on this account also, and definitely the bank will ask you why you are withdrawing this amount of time.
You tell them it’s a medical emergency.
If the bank people came to know that you’re affiliated with the IRS and still making payments, they will not allow you to withdraw this amount else they will call the police directly, and you’ll get arrested.
Kelly’s part is over because we are the one who - 
I said that this is not her job.
She’s not investigation officer.
Just notify me when you reach the parking lot of the bank and I will do what all you want to do there, ok?
Yes I’m here, yes I’m here.
Thirty five hundred? Hold on, hold on.
Thanks for holding mr kendall.
Ok mr kendall, do you have any government certified stores near you?
Like a walmart, or a 7-11.
Ok so you have to get into your walmart and you will purchase a form called person-to-person moneygram form.
It is person to person.
Yeah three ways to send money so company to company, or walmart to walmart or person to person.
Do you have any doubt by doing moneygram?
If the walmart people ask you why you are transferring this amount, then you will have to tell them its a business transaction.
If the store people came to know that you are sending money to the irs -
Uh yeah three thousand four hundred and twenty three in dollar.
Yes you can transfer it in US dollars.
