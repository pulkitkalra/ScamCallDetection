This is the US department of treasury, federal tax branch how may I help?
I need to pull out your case file information in front of my system and then and only I can go for the step and I can explain you what it's all about and what is going on
ok let me pull out your case file
okay thanks for being online right now pertaining to this case file well mr. botsko I would like to notify you that this line is is being federally monitored and recorded by the IRS headquarters and higher authorities 
so I would request you do not interrupt me inbetween while I'm giving you all the informations and once I'm done for my part I will give you fair enough chance to speak if you have any further questions okay 
so there is a lawsuit case under your name against the tax fraud case and the audit department
there is the audit Department who audited your case file randomly between the years of 2011 to 2016 and we found something unusual going under the calculations of geo tax filing 
and so duration of five years there was a miscalculation on your tax filing for the amount of twenty seven hundred and forty six dollars 177 cents 
that is two thousand seven hundred and forty six dollars and seventy seven cents 
so it seems that this has been unpaid amount this was the miscalculation paid taxes including a penalty charges allegation charges and some of them miscalculations
So we discovered the strong evidence inside the courthouse that it was actually the result of an innocent negligence
rather we have the strong reason to believe that it was willful act to defraud the federal government of the United States 
those four allegations which are present against you are count one violation of federal tax regulation count two the Internal Revenue Code count three theft by deception and count four willful misrepresentation
not a lot just only twenty seven hundred and forty six dollars point seventy seven cents 
and if you try to run away from the situation or else if you'll not rectify the case file  that number one the IRS will mark a lien on your assets including your house and car if it is registered under your name 
all of your bank accounts could be frozen and confiscated which means that you would not be able to recover your tax debt from the balance available in your bank accounts you would not be able to access your bank accounts in the time it is frozen
number three all your wages and benefits would be frozen by informing your employer and then the government bodies and your passport will be seized along with your state ID 
and your  current driving license and if you belongs to a country other than the United States then you might be run the risk of being deported back 
so finally so I have completed with my legal affidavit now so I told you if you have any questions then you may go ahead and ask me right now before we take any kind of legal action or else before we arrest you
yes your local sheriff department will be going to come at your doorsteps once we are going to fax your arrest warrant ID to your local county 
I would like to know your intention sir I'm not here to force you mr. Bosco I'm not here to convince you but as the courthouses in your past genuine records that you are filing your taxes properly a year in a proper manner 
they have given you the chance to take care of this case file out of the courthouse so I would like to know your intentions that are willing to resolve this case out of the courthouse by verifying outstanding taxes amount itself without getting arrested

I would like to ask you that you have the sufficient amount with you to take care of those case file that is twenty thousand hundred and forty six dollars 
there would be the standard legal procedure which to follow is known as EFTPS electronic federally tax payment system 
so for that reason I will guide you okay there will be the accounting department the legal advisor who will going to guide you for further steps. so will you able to take care about those case files 
on the same federally monitored recorded line?
Okay what I'm going to do is that first of all you should you are not authorized to disconnect this phone call and you should be on the same monitored recorded line because we need to record
this whole conversation with you to submit this call recording inside the courthouse 
that you are not running out of situations and you are trying to take care about this case file by yourself  
There will be the standard legal procedure sir I told you you need to purchase the revenue vouchers from the government certified store 
right now what happened is that we are not authorized to make this payment through your debit confirmation your credit card information or else your banking information 
I'm not to provide as well as you are not authorized to provide me any of your personal information 
Yes perfectly you have to purchase a Google Play gift card each for five hundred dollars in total you need to purchase six cards for Google Play 
so will you able to finish this procedure by reaching down to the Walmart store or Best Buy government certified store right now itself
You need to do this right now
